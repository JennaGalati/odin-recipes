    <h1>Old Fashioned Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="../Images/pancakes.jpg"alt="Stacks of pancakes with syrup and butter">
        <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>3.5 tsp baking powder</li>
                
        <li>1/4 tsp of salt</li>
                
        <li>1 tbls white sugar</li>
                
        <li>1.5 cups milk</li>
                
        <li>1 egg</li>
                
        <li>3 tbls butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
